# <Password-Generator>

## Description

My goal in building this project was to practice JavaScript by creating an interactive website that randomly generates a password after the user answers prompts. This project taught me that in JavaScript it really is the small stuff most of the time. I stared down my code for about an hour before I realized I just had capitalized one of the letters in a variable.


## Usage

First, user clicks the "Generate Password" button. The JavaScript will prompt you as to the length of your password, as well as if you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After the questions are answered, your password will be printed to replace the placholder: Your secure password.
